1. Project Setup & Configuration
   Objective: Establish the foundation for your project, configuring necessary tools.

Steps:

Initialize a new React project with TypeScript.
Set up version control (Git) and push your initial code to GitHub.
Install and configure Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling.
Set up React Router for handling routes between different pages (Home, Shop, Cart, etc.).
Plan the folder structure. Ensure clear separation of concerns (e.g., separate folders for components, pages, hooks, services, Redux store).
Tip: Consider using a consistent naming convention for files and folders to maintain clarity.

2. Building the Initial Pages & Layout
   Objective: Establish the overall layout of the application and implement routing.

Steps:

Build a responsive navigation bar with links to core pages: Home, Shop, Cart, Profile.
Create a layout component that wraps around all pages, ensuring common elements like navigation and footer are persistent.
Implement the Home page:
Create sections such as "Featured Products" and "Categories" (e.g., Smartphones, Laptops, Accessories).
Ensure responsiveness, so the layout works well on both desktop and mobile.
Build a footer with relevant links (e.g., Contact, Privacy Policy).
Tip: Break down the UI into reusable components (e.g., NavBar, Footer, CategoryCard, etc.).

3. Product Listings & FakestoreAPI Integration
   Objective: Fetch and display product data from the FakestoreAPI.

Steps:

Create a Shop page that will list all products from the electronics category of FakestoreAPI.
Fetch the product data from the /products/category/electronics endpoint of FakestoreAPI.
Display products in a grid format with the following details:
Product name
Image
Price
Ratings (if available)
Implement basic filtering on the Shop page (e.g., filter by sub-category, price range).
Handle loading, error, and empty states gracefully when fetching data.
Tip: Abstract API fetching logic into a separate service or custom hook for reusability across components.

4. Product Details Page
   Objective: Allow users to view detailed information about a specific product.

Steps:

Create a dynamic route (e.g., /product/:id) to handle product details.
Fetch product data from the FakestoreAPI using the product ID from the URL (use the /products/:id endpoint).
Display detailed information, such as:
Product title
Full description
Price
Specifications (if applicable)
User ratings and reviews
"Add to Cart" button
Design the page to be mobile-friendly, ensuring product images and details adjust to various screen sizes.
Tip: Use URL parameters to dynamically fetch and display the correct product based on the ID.

5. Cart Functionality (Using Redux for State Management)
   Objective: Implement the shopping cart functionality using Redux to manage state across the app.

Steps:

Set up Redux and create the necessary files for your store, actions, and reducers.
Define actions for cart management:
Add product to cart
Remove product from cart
Update product quantity
Create a Cart page that:
Displays all added products with their names, prices, and quantities.
Allows users to modify the quantity or remove items.
Shows the total price of the cart.
Ensure that cart state persists across page refreshes (consider using localStorage or sessionStorage).
Tip: Break down Redux logic into well-defined actions and reducers, keeping state updates predictable and organized.

6. User Authentication
   Objective: Implement basic user authentication for account management.

Steps:

Create login and signup forms for users to authenticate.
Handle form validation (e.g., email format, password length).
Use a mock API or external service (e.g., Firebase) to simulate user authentication.
Store the user’s authentication status globally using Redux.
Protect certain routes (e.g., Cart, Checkout) so that only authenticated users can access them.
Build a user profile page where users can view and edit their personal details.
Tip: Use protected routes in React Router to control access based on authentication status.

7. Checkout & Payment Simulation
   Objective: Allow users to complete the purchase with a mock checkout process.

Steps:

Create a Checkout page that summarizes the user’s cart.
Design a form for users to enter their shipping information and payment details.
Simulate payment processing using a mock API or integration (like Stripe).
On successful payment, redirect users to a confirmation page showing order details.
Provide feedback for potential errors during the checkout process (e.g., invalid payment info).
Tip: Mock the payment process with dummy data if you aren't integrating a real payment provider.

8. Responsive Design & Tailwind CSS Polishing
   Objective: Ensure that all pages are fully responsive across a wide range of devices.

Steps:

Test all pages (Home, Shop, Product Details, Cart, Checkout) on different screen sizes using browser dev tools.
Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for margins, padding, and breakpoints to ensure smooth scaling.
Optimize UI elements such as product cards, images, and buttons for touch devices.
Add hover states, transitions, and animations to improve the user experience on desktop.
Ensure legibility of text and visibility of images on smaller screens.
Tip: Prioritize mobile-first design, then enhance for larger screens.

9. Testing (Unit & Integration)
   Objective: Implement testing to ensure reliability of components and application logic.

Steps:

Set up a testing framework for your app (consider Jest and React Testing Library).
Write unit tests for smaller, reusable components (e.g., product card, buttons).
Write integration tests for larger, page-level components (e.g., Shop, Cart, Checkout).
Test Redux actions and reducers to ensure they are updating state correctly.
Ensure adequate test coverage for critical flows like:
Adding/removing items from the cart
Fetching and displaying products from FakestoreAPI
User authentication
Create tests for edge cases, such as empty states and API failures.
Tip: Prioritize testing critical functionality first, then expand coverage.

10. Deployment
    Objective: Deploy the TechStore project to a live environment.

Steps:

Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel for seamless deployment.
Set up any necessary environment variables (e.g., API keys).
Test the deployed version to ensure it works correctly in production.
Verify that the site is responsive, functional, and secure in its deployed state.
Share the link for feedback and further testing.
Tip: Use Vercel's built-in performance tools to monitor and improve loading speeds.
